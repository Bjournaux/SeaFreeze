# SeaFreeze

V0.9.1 (Matlab version)

The SeaFreeze package allows to compute the thermodynamic and elastic properties of water and ice polymorphs (Ih, III, V and VI) in the 0-2300 MPa and 220-500K range, with the study of icy worlds and their ocean in mind. It is based on the evaluation of Gibbs Local Basis Functions parametrization (https://github.com/jmichaelb/LocalBasisFunction) for each phase. The formalism is described in more details in Brown (2018), Journaux et al. (2019), and in the liquid water Gibbs parametrization by Bollengier, Brown, and Shaw (2019). 

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

This Matlab version of SeaFreeze has been tested on MATLAB_R2018a. SeaFreeze does not need any other toolboxes to work. Nonetheless, the "Curve Fitting Toolbox" allows to run the code significantly faster when evaluating a list of points rather than a grid.

### Installing

To install SeaFreeze, either change your active directory to SeaFreeze/Matlab, or add that directory to your Matlab path.  In either case, the SeaFreeze_Gibbs.mat file must be in the same directory as the Matlab functions.

## Running SeaFreeze

### Inputs
To run the SeaFreeze function you need to provide pressure (MPa) and temperature (K) coordinates and a material input:

```
out=SeaFreeze(PT,'material')
```

PT is a structure (gridded output) or array (scatter output) containing pressure-temperature points (MPa and Kelvin).

'material' defines which ice or water to use.  Possibilities:
- 'Ih' for ice Ih (Feistel and Wagner, 2006)
- 'III' for ice III (Journaux et al. 2019)
- 'V' for ice V (Journaux et al. 2019)
- 'VI' for ice VI (Journaux et al. 2019)
- 'water1' for Bollengier et al. (2019) LBF extending to 500 K and 2300 MPa
- 'water2' for the modified EOS in Brown 2018 extending to 100 GPa
- 'water_IAPWS95' for IAPWS95 water (Wagner and Pruss, 2002)

### Outputs
out is a structure containing all output quantities (SI units):

## Example

An executable matlab live script (Example_SeaFreeze.mlx) is provided allowing to run the following examples.

### Single point input

## Important remarks 
### Water representation
The ices Gibbs parametrizations are optimized to be used with 'water1' Gibbs LBF from Bollengier et al. (2019), specially for phase equilibrium calculation. Using other water parametrization wil lead to incorect melting curves. 'water2' (Brown 2018) and 'water_IAPWS95' (IAPWS95) parametrization are provided for HP extention (up to 100 GPa) and comparison only. The authors recommend the use of 'water1' (Bollengier et al. 2019) for any application in the 200-355 K range and up to 2300 MPa.

### Ices phase diagram
The current version of SeaFreeze does not inlcude stable ice II Local basis function parametrization (It will be in the near future). Therefore the phase diagram generated is not yet valid below 248.8K and between 208.6 and 620 MPa which delimit the current accepted stability field of ice II (Bridgman, 1912).

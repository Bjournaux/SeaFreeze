The SeaFreeze package allows to compute the thermodynamic and elastic properties of water and ice polymorphs (Ih, II, III, V and VI) in the 0-2300 MPa and 220-500K range. It is based on the evaluation of Gibbs Local Basis Functions parametrization (https://github.com/jmichaelb/LocalBasisFunction) for each phase, constructed to reproduce thermodynamic measurments. The formalism is described in more details in [Journaux et al. (2020)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JE006176), and in the liquid water Gibbs parametrization by [Bollengier, Brown, and Shaw (2019)](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5097179). 


## Getting Started


### Installing
Report to the READEME file for each version (Python or Matlab) for installing SeaFreeze.


## Running SeaFreeze

This section provide basic example on how to run SeaFreeze. It is using pseudo code, so synthax will change depdending on the version used. 

### Inputs
To run the SeaFreeze function you need to provide pressure (MPa) and temperature (K) coordinates and a material input:

```
out=SeaFreeze(PT,'material')
```

PT is a structure (gridded output) or array (scatter output) containing pressure-temperature points (MPa and Kelvin).

'material' defines which ice or water to use.  Possibilities:
- 'Ih' for ice Ih (Feistel and Wagner, 2006)
- 'II' for ice II (Journaux et al. 2020)
- 'III' for ice III (Journaux et al. 2020)
- 'V' for ice V (Journaux et al. 2020)
- 'VI' for ice VI (Journaux et al. 2020)
- 'water1' for Bollengier et al. (2019) LBF extending to 500 K and 2300 MPa
- 'water2' for the modified EOS in Brown 2018 extending to 100 GPa and 10,000 K
- 'water_IAPWS95' for IAPWS95 water (Wagner and Pruss, 2002)

### Outputs
out is a structure containing all output quantities (SI units):


| Quantity        |  Symbol in SeaFreeze  |  Unit (SI)  |
| --------------- |:---------------------:| :----------:|
| Gibbs Energy           | `G` | J/kg |

|Specific heat capacity at constant pressure|`Cp`| J/kg/K |
|Specific heat capacity at constant volume|`Cv`| J/kg/K |
| Isothermal bulk modulus      |`Kt`| MPa |
|Pressure derivative of the Isothermal bulk modulus|`Kp`| - |
| Isoentropic bulk modulus     |`Ks`| MPa |
| Thermal expansivity     |`alpha`| /K |

| P wave velocity     |`Vp`| m/s |
| S wave velocity     |`Vs`| m/s |
| Bulk sound speed     |`vel`| m/s |

 **NaN values returned when out of parametrization boundaries.**




## Example

## Important remarks 
### Water representation
The ices Gibbs parametrizations are optimized to be used with 'water1' Gibbs LBF from Bollengier et al. (2019), specially for phase equilibrium calculation. Using other water parametrization wil lead to incorect melting curves. 'water2' (Brown 2018) and 'water_IAPWS95' (IAPWS95) parametrization are provided for HP extention (up to 100 GPa) and comparison only. The authors recommend the use of 'water1' (Bollengier et al. 2019) for any application in the 200-355 K range and up to 2300 MPa.

### Range of validity
SeaFreeze stability prediction is currently considered valid down to 130K, which correspond to the ice VI - ice XV transition. The ice Ih - II transition is potentially valid down to 73.4 K (ice Ih - ice XI transition).

The following figure shows the prediction of phase transitions from SeaFreeze (melting & solid-solid) and comparison with experimental data:
